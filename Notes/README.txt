All notes have been migrated to a series of (Google Docs)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10zMP4WC_JrgfCo4MIA0Rbd_CG80KZMiP?usp=sharing], which I have made publically viewable. I hope all my fellow machine learning enthusiasts get as much joy and learning from this textbook as I did!

NOTE: This project is no longer actively maintained since May 31, 2021. If you have any content-related questions about my notes, please reference the publisher's slides or the textbook itself.
