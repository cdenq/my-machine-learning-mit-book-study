EDIT: The class slides I helped create for the COMP452 class at CSUN are no longer publically available, as per the updated guidelines from the Department of Engineering and Computer Science at CSUN. Please contact me at christopherdenq@gmail.com if you wish to discuss.

If you are a fellow machine learning enthusiast, the publisher has released reference slides for the textbook that are available online. Please utilize those for your learning journey!
