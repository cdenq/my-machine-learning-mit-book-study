## About Notes for Fund. of ML for Predictive Data Analytics (Kelleher, Namee, D'Arcy)

`Notes on Fund. of ML for Pred. Analytics` is a collection of self-study notes and code snippets I made for:
Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies
By John D. Kelleher, Brian Mac Namee and Aoife D'Arcy

This book was published by MITPress in 2015, and was used in COMP452: Machine Learning, taught at the California State University, Northridge by Professor Wen-chin Hsu.

As part of my work experience with assisting that class, I got access to this textbook.
