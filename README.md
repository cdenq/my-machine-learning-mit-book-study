## About Notes for Fund. of ML for Predictive Data Analytics (Kelleher, Namee, D'Arcy)

`Notes on Fund. of ML for Pred. Analytics` is a collection of self-study notes and code snippets I made for:
Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples, and Case Studies
By John D. Kelleher, Brian Mac Namee and Aoife D'Arcy

This book was published by MITPress in 2015, and was used in COMP452: Machine Learning, taught at the California State University, Northridge by Professor Wen-chin Hsu.

As part of my work experience with assisting that class, I got access to this textbook.

## Notice

As of February 2022, updated guidelines from the Department of Engineering and Computer Science at CSUN prevents me from publically dissemiating official course content including coding examples, slides, and more. Please contact me privately if you wish to discuss.

This repo will contain my self-created notes for `Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics`, which were not part of the class.
